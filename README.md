### A matrix management library in C
## Description

This is one of my personal projects.
It's a library made to manage matrices in C.

Functions are listed in the `include/matrix.h` file and each file is documented.

## Usage

To use this library:
- add the `/include/matrix.h` file to your project's include ectory.
- add the `/matrix_lib` directory to your project's root.
- Add the matrix files to your project's compilation.
- And voil√†! You can now use the functions in your project.
