# c_matrix
### A matrix management library in C
## Description

This is one of my personal projects.
It's a library made to manage matrices in C.

Functions are listed in the `include/matrix.h` file and each file is documented.
## Usage

To use this library:
- add the `/include/matrix.h` file to your project's include ectory.
- add the `/matrix_lib` directory to your project's root.
- Add the matrix files to your project's compilation.
- And voil√†! You can now use the functions in your project.

## Disclaimer

I started programming in october 2023 and all my projects are there to try new things so feel free to address any issues you see or any improvements you think of.

Also, the code here is written to comply with EPITECH's coding style. This is why I use the EPITECH header, some functions are cut in half during loops and if/if are used instead of if/else if (One of the many style errors is : Conditional block with more than 3 branches, or at a nesting level of 3 or more)
